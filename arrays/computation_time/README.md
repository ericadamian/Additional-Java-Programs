# Array vs arraylist computation time

- Arrays are easier with handling data (such as expanding size)
- Arraylists are more complex, as they may need to fetch the list's size and inner array (which requires more time); may need to create a new array and copy any data over

- Program execution shows how arrays are more efficient in time calculations compared to that of arraylists
